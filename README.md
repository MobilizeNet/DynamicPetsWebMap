# Dynamic Pets

One common question people has for WebMap is:

> Does it support dynamic components?

And the answer is yes it does.

**Dynamic Pets** is a small sample to show how WebMap handles dynamic components. 

You can find the [WinForms source code here](https://github.com/MobilizeNet/DynamicPets)

The main screen is as follows:

Press clear and now you can add a cat by pressing the light blue button:

If you do not want to waste a lot of time setting up an environment, you can open this application on [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io).

[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) is a great company that allows you to get your repo up and runnning hosted on a cloud IDE.

This is cloud environment that shows how this migrated application can be taken all the way from VB6 to a dockerized Linux container :)
